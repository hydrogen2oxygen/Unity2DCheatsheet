# Unity2DCheatsheet
A cheatsheet for Unity's 2D features. It's based on [this cheat sheet](http://cdn1.raywenderlich.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UnityCheatsheet-0_1.pdf) but I've modified it for 2D.

## Physics 

### Rigidbodies
To make a GameObject under the control of the physics engine, add a ```Rigidbody2D```component.

With ```Rigidbodies2D``` do not attempt to move them by ```Transform``` properties (rotation, scale, position). Instead apply forces.

### Colliders

```c#
BoxCollider2D
CircleCollider2D
PolygonCollider2D
```

### Floors, walls, and other motionless elements
Add a collider to an object, but don't add a Rigidbody component.


## Controlling the camera
For 2D, donâ€™t mess with the Scene Gizmo. In Unity 5 the gizmo isn't even available when viewing in "2D" mode:

![Scene Gizmo](images/scene-gizmo.png)
``` don't mess with this guy ```

If you mess with the Scene Gizmo and can't get back to your original camera position, close the Scene Tab and Reopen it.

## GameObject Events

###Update()
Called once per frame.

###FixedUpdate()
Called multiple times per frame.
Should be used when applying forces or other physics related functions.

##Input

### Conventional

```C#
Input.GetAxis("Horizontal")
Input.GetAxis("Vertical")
```

### Mobile

Mobile uses an Input.Touch data structure.

Useful properties include ```position``` and ```deltaPosition``` (change in position since the last frame).


```C#
var particle : GameObject;
function Update () {
    for (var touch : Touch in Input.touches) {
        if (touch.phase == TouchPhase.Began) {
            // Construct a ray from the current touch coordinates
            var ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay (touch.position);
            if (Physics.Raycast (ray)) {
                // Create a particle if hit
                Instantiate (particle, transform.position, transform.rotation);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Useful Math Functions
Mathf.Max

Mathf.Min

Mathf.Clamp

Mathf.PingPong
